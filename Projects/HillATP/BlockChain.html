    <h1>Blockchain</h1>
    <p>A <b>decentralized</b> way to work.</p>
    <p>Blockchain is a public list of records that is distributed, consistent, and irreversible. Since these records are
      distributed, there isn’t a sole person or entity that controls the information on the blockchain. It’s immutable
      and records are consistent across all nodes in the system.</p>

        <h2 class="newh2">Blockchain Basics</h2>
      </div>
      <h2>A Guide for Everyone</h2>
      <p>What is the blockchain and why should you care about it? Hailed by some as the biggest force for change in our
        time and by others as a fringe realm inhabited by criminals, anarchists, and libertarians, one thing is certain;
        the blockchain is here to stay.
      </p>
      <p>
        What follows is my attempt to explain in everyday language what the blockchain is, where it came from, what the
        potential risks are, and the effect that it will have on our lives and businesses going forward.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Bits and Blocks</h2>
      <p>The blockchain was originally developed as the underpinnings of the original crypto-currency ‘Bitcoin’. So to
        properly understand blockchain, we must first take a look at what Bitcoin was trying to achieve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bitcoin was designed to be a decentralised cryptocurrency, free of the need for a third-party intermediary. It
        achieved this by publicly broadcasting all transactions across all computers in its distributed network.
      </p>
      <p>
        The role of the blockchain was to provide a way for all computers across this distributed network to reach a
        consensus (agreement) about what transactions have occurred and who owns what, all without the need for a
        central authority (like a bank or government). This is known as a public ledger, and is available for anyone to
        verify at any time. In essence blockchain can be view as this public ledger.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>How blockchain works</h2>
      <p>
        Blockchain records transactions by a process of five steps.
      </p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>
          Transactions made using a specific protocol (bitcoin for example) and are bundled into a timestamped ‘block’
          with a unique identifier called a ‘hash’.
        </li>
        <li>
          Computers on the network race to be the first to discover (through a process called ‘mining’) the correct hash
          for this particular block. Called ‘proof-of-work’ this is a very processing power resource intensive action.
          The successful miner (the computer that was first to discover the correct hash for the block) is then awarded
          with some sort of prize (some bitcoin for example) as an incentive to keep as many computer resources
          maintaining the network as possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the particular block’s hash is correctly identified, or ‘solved’, it is broadcast over the network where
          it needs to be verified by the majority of other computers to be considered valid.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once considered valid, the accepted block is then linked to the existing chain of blocks, with its hash being
          used as the starting point for the next block. In this way each block is intrinsically linked to all the
          blocks that have gone before it.
        </li>
        <li>
          This complete record of every transaction is shared across every computer on the network, and can be inspected
          by anyone allowing a completely public, immutable, and verifiable record of transactions and ownership.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        To help visualise this, picture the blockchain as a tower of lego, where blocks are added one by one on top of
        each other. The tower is visible to anyone (publically verifiable) and once built the order of the blocks cannot
        be changed (immutable).
      </p>
      <br>

      <br>
      <h2>Security Concerns</h2>
      <p>The security of the blockchain lies in the large amount of distributed computers, combining to create vast
        amounts of processing power spread over the network.
      </p>
      <p>
        The process by which blocks are created is unique and cannot be cheated, it is possible in theory for a
        malicious actor to to create a false block by generating an entirely new blockchain, including corresponding
        proof-of-works, and then adding this new sequence to the existing blockchain by outpacing the main, consensus
        approved, chain.
      </p>
      <p>
        The processing power required to do such a thing would have to exceed that of the combined network, a near
        impossible feat, and one that is made exponentially more difficult the larger a network grows. On large networks
        such as the bitcoin network, it is unrealistic in the extreme; although newer, smaller networks may be
        vulnerable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The network is also vulnerable to what is called a ‘51% attack’. If a certain actor was to control 51% of the
        processing power of a network, he or she could deny any or all new transactions from being added to the
        blockchain. This however does not affect the immutability of previous blocks, only those going forward. This is
        again difficult because of the astronomical amount of computing power required. It has also been suggested that
        it would be more profitable for such an actor to collect the reward for verifying legitimate transactions.
        It is worth noting at this time that so far the only network of sufficient size to minimise the above risks to
        an acceptable degree is the Bitcoin network. This is due to its enormous network size and the vast amount of
        capital that has already been invested in its infrastructure. It remains unclear if other networks will ever
        overcome this first-mover advantage, or if the majority of development will continue to consolidate on the
        bitcoin blockchain.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final issue with blockchain technology is not intrinsic to blockchain itself, but rather to how individuals
        protect themselves. Just like email or online banking, a set of credentials (username and password for example)
        are required to interact with and secure your assets. And these credentials can be stolen in the traditional
        means, via scams, blackmail, or hacking a database which your information is stored.
        In this way the blockchain can never be ‘hacked’ like a traditional system, however individuals can still be
        susceptible to identity theft.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Real world implications</h2>
      <p>While not immediately apparent, the ability to have a peer-to-peer public ledger without third party
        verification has far reaching ramifications.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the highest level it creates an environment where transactions can take place without the need to trust the
        other party or intermediary. This ‘trustless’ property of blockchain allows parties to conduct business with
        complete confidence that the details of the deal are indisputable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The technology of blockchain opens up a world of self-executing ‘smart-contracts’. This is a contract where
        certain outcomes are irrevocably linked to predetermined conditions. For instance, when a shipment of good is
        marked as received (the condition) payment would automatically be forwarded to the supplier’s account (the
        outcome). This would virtually eliminate the need for third-party verification and payment/escrow services.
        Finally the ability to have an immutable and publicly viewable ledger of accounts and assets would completely
        remove the possibility for accounting fraud. An indisputable public record of transfers and assets, of
        everything from crypto-currency to share ownership to voting rights, is perhaps the greatest shift that
        blockchain technology unlocks.</p>
